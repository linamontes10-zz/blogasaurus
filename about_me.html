  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p> My name is Lina Montes. I have many interests that range from soccer, food, and dogs. I am also quite the netflix-enthusiast. I am an incoming first year at Yale University. I was born, grew up, and currently live in Yonkers, NY in Westchester County - apparently some of you refer to that as upstate. There is a lot to who I am. I am Colombian. I am a feminist. I am a dog owner. I am an athlete. I am a coder. I am a foodie. I can not be me unless I am all of those things. In many ways, I see myself as an extremely versatile human.
